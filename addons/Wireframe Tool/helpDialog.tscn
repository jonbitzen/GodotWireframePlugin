The problem of pure wireframe look is that every edge of the model is rendered. And because every model has to be triangulated before rendering, you will get a very noisy look with a lot of unwanted triangles. This tool will help you to create customized wireframe from imported mesh.

[color=#f43799][u]HOW TO USE:[/u][/color]

[color=#9393ce]Target Mesh/Surface:[/color] Select the surface you want to edit. You can select multiple MeshInstances in editor and switch between them. Don't select multiple meshes if you want to edit the wireframe. Use it only for Copy tool. 
[color=#9393ce]Rename Surface:[/color] You can rename surfaces in Inspector but if you generated the wireframe, this mesh now has metadata and they are link to the wireframe by surface name. So if you generated the wireframe, rename the surface using this tool! The name should be unique.
[color=#9393ce]Delete Surface:[/color] This will delete selected surface together with metadata. No undo.
[color=#9393ce]Source Mesh/Surface:[/color] Select the surface you want to copy. You can't unfortunately copy wireframe surface (this is an engine problem - MeshDataTool can't work with primitive GL_LINES).
[color=#9393ce]Copy:[/color] Copy selected source surface to selected target mesh. If you want to bundle occlusion geometry together with wireframe to one mesh, copy occlusion geometry to wireframe. It won't work the other way (wireframe to occlusion). You can't copy surface if there's surface in target mesh with the same name.

[color=#f43799]Wireframe Tools[/color]
[color=#9393ce]Generate:[/color] Generate wireframe from selected surface (target surface). Metadata are generated and saved to Mesh.
[color=#9393ce]Commit:[/color] If you're happy with the wireframe and you don't want to edit it anymore, you can commit the changes. After this step, you won't be able to edit the wireframe but your scene file will be smaller because of deleted metadata. There is no point to export the game with unnecessary metadata.
[color=#9393ce]Cancel:[/color] This will revert the surface back to it's orginal state before the wireframe was generated. Metadata will be of course deleted too.

[color=#f43799]Selection Tools[/color]
[color=#9393ce]None:[/color] No selection tool. Plugin won't capture your mouse input so you will be able to use gizmos of 3D editor.
[color=#9393ce]Vertex:[/color] Select one vertex. Any other selection tool + Alt will also do vertex selection. If you click on selected vertex, it will be deselected. Ctrl + vertex selection works as a color picker.
[color=#9393ce]Edge:[/color] Select one or more edges. If you click on selected edge, it will be deselected.
[color=#9393ce]All:[/color] Select every edge in surface. If every edge is already selected, they will be deselected. It works like in Blender. Shortcut is key A.
[color=#9393ce]Inverse:[/color] Inverse the selection. Shortcut is key I.

[color=#f43799]Actions[/color]
[color=#9393ce]Delete:[/color] Delete selected vertex or edges. Shortcut is key D.
[color=#9393ce]Color:[/color] Color selected vertex or edges with color next to this button. Shortcut is key C.

[color=#f43799]Materials[/color]
[color=#9393ce]Unlit:[/color] Assign to surface a simple unlit material which shows vertex colors.
[color=#9393ce]Lit:[/color] Assign to surface a simple lit material which shows vertex colors. Formula is based on Half Lambert. Don't forget to select Ambient color - color of dark areas.
[color=#9393ce]Outline:[/color] You can create an outline using this material. Create a separate wireframe for outline (from FLAT shaded mesh !!!) and use this shader on it. Occlude unwanted wires by occlusion geometry.
[color=#9393ce]Occlusion:[/color] This material is for occlusion geometry. By default, wireframe is not opaque. You have to create an occlusion mesh and assign this material to it. Don't forget to select Ambient color. It should be same as the background color so this mesh will look like invisible.

[color=#f43799][u]CONTROLS:[/u][/color]
LMB: Selection tool
LMB + Alt: Vertex selection tool
Vertex selection tool + Ctrl: Color picker
D: Delete selected edge(s) or vertex
A: Select/deselect all
I: Inverse selection
C: Color selection
Ctrl + Z: Editor undo
Shift + Ctrl + Z: Editor redo

[color=#f43799][u]FAQ:[/u][/color]
[color=lime]I can't select edge/vertex[/color] 
Your model probably has some duplicated edges. This happens when your model is flat shaded. The edge is selected but you can't see it because there is another one on the top of it. Either delete one of them or smooth your model before export.

[color=lime]I selected the valid surface but I can't edit the wireframe[/color] 
Did you rename the surface using Inspector? You can do it until you hit Generate button. Use Rename tool after that.

[color=lime]I selected multiple MeshInstances but I can't edit wireframe[/color]
Multiple selection works right now only with Copy tool. If you want to edit wireframe, select only one MeshInstance.

[color=lime]Commit/Cancel deleted my colors[/color]
No, they didn't. Surface which is being edited has a special unshaded material which shows vertex colors. Commit/Cancel buttons will delete this material, but your model still has vertex colors.

[color=lime]I would like to change thickness of lines. How?[/color]
Change Line Width property in material.

[color=#f43799][u]Changelog 1.0 -> 2.0:[/u][/color]
- functions of plugin are now inside the new dock
- metadata are now saved to Mesh instead of MeshInstance. This breaks the compatibility but makes more sense.
- support of multiple surfaces per Mesh
- undo/redo support for wft actions
- copy tool (copy selected surface from one Mesh to another)
- renaming tool (every change of surface name needs to be reflected in metadata)
- new selection tool None won't capture input so you can use spatial editor gizmos
- new selection tools Loop, All and Inverse
- selection tool Vertex works also as a color picker (LMB + Ctrl)
- actions Color (selected vertex/edges) and Delete (selected vertex/edges)
- new outline shader
- UVs and bones are now transfered to wireframe mesh
- warnings now show inside the dock"
